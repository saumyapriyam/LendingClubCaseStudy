# Lending Club Case Study
Lending money to applicants who might not repay it is a major cause of financial loss, known as credit loss. Credit loss means the money a lender loses when borrowers don't pay back their loans or run away without repaying.

### General Information
Our main goal here is to find these risky loan applicants effectively. This will help us reduce such loans and lower the overall credit loss. We'll use a method called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify these applicants, and that's the main focus of this case study.

This analysis is all about finding out what factors make loans go bad. We call these factors 'driver variables' because they strongly indicate the risk of a loan not being repaid. The company can use this knowledge to improve how it manages its loans and assess the risk involved.

### Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning - In this initial step, the data will be cleaned and prepared for analysis, ensuring that it is accurate and free from inconsistencies.

### Univariate Analysis
Univariate Analysis - This step involves examining individual variables one at a time to gain insights into their distributions and characteristics.

## Segmented Univariate Analysis
Segmented Univariate Analysis - Here, the focus shifts to studying variable segments, helping identify patterns within specific groups or categories.


### Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis - This step explores relationships between variables, including how multiple factors may influence loan default.

### Conclusions
- The borrower belongs to a lower grade, like F or G; and especially the subgrade F5, G3, G5.
- The loan amount is in the range 0 to 21000.
- The annual income of borrower is between 30000 and 60000.
- The borrower has a rented home and the loan is for the purpose of debt consolidation.
- The loan period is of 60 months and the loan status is 'verified'.
- The interest rate is in the range 15-20%.
- The purpose of the loan is small business.
